# ipl-score-win-predictor-dass74

This project aims to predict the scores and the winning team in IPL (Indian Premier League) matches using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The Indian Premier League is a popular T20 cricket league held annually in India. This project focuses on two aspects of IPL matches:

1. **Score Prediction**: Predicting the total runs scored by a team in an IPL match based on various factors such as batting team, bowling team, hosting city, current match situation and historical match data.

2. **Win Prediction**: Predicting the winning team in an IPL match based on factors like batting team, bowling team, hosting city, current match situation and head to head match data.

The project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze historical IPL data and generate predictions for future matches.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset comprising historical IPL match data, including team information, player statistics, match results, and pitch conditions. The dataset is obtained from reliable sources such as Kaggle. Preprocessing and feature engineering are performed on the dataset to make it suitable for model training and evaluation.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies and tools are used in this project:

- Python: The primary programming language for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, xgboost and lightgbm for implementing machine learning models.
- Streamlit: A Python library used to build interactive web applications for showcasing the predictions and results.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library for preprocessing the dataset.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for exploratory data analysis and prototyping ML models.

## Usage

To run the IPL score and win prediction:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Import the datasets for training: `IPL_Matches_2008_2022.csv` and `IPL_Ball_by_Ball_2008_2022.csv`.

3. Train the machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset using the provided Jupyter Notebook.

4. Once the models are trained, run the Streamlit application to interactively predict scores and winning teams: `streamlit run app.py`.

## Results

The project provides insights into the factors that influence IPL match outcomes and predicts the scores and winning teams with a certain level of accuracy. The accuracy and performance metrics of the models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as r2 score, mean absolute error, accuracy score.

## Future Enhancements

There are several areas for further improvement and expansion of this project:

- Incorporating real-time data to update the predictions during live IPL matches.
- Considering additional features like weather conditions, player injuries, and team strategies.
- Experimenting with advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques like ensemble models, deep learning, or reinforcement learning.
